# Reload Workspace

Please re-read all source files in the workspace directory and forget any outdated information you might have.

After reloading:
- Summarize any changes you detect (new, deleted, modified files)
- Show me a list of updated files with relative paths
- Do not perform any modifications yet â€” just sync your memory with the current filesystem
